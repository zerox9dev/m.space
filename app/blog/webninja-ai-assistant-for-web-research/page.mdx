# WebNinja: AI Assistant for Web Research

Hi! I want to share my small hobby project — WebNinja. Inspired by AI Manus (and the community's playful "anus" 😄), I decided to create my own mini-version of a web research agent.

---

## What is it?

WebNinja is a simple yet functional tool that:

- 🤖 Uses AI (Grok or GPT-4) to analyze information
- 🔍 Collects data from websites
- 📊 Generates reports based on the collected data

---

## How can it be used?

### For designers:
- Quick analysis of design trends
- Collecting references from various sites
- Monitoring new things in UI/UX

### For developers:
- Tracking tech news
- Analyzing new tools and frameworks
- Collecting feature implementation examples

### For others:
- Marketing research
- Competitor analysis
- Monitoring news in any field

---

## How to get started?

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/zerox9dev-space/WebNinja.git
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
python -m venv .myenv
source .myenv/bin/activate  # for Linux/Mac
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. Create a .env file and add your API key:
```
GROK_API_KEY=your-key-here or OPENAI_API_KEY=your-key-here
```

4. Run the example:
```bash
python examples/research_agent.py
```

---

## Usage examples

### For designers:
```python
topic = "UI design trends 2024"
agent.research(topic, depth=3)  # Checks 3 sources
```

### For developers:
```python
topic = "New features in Python 3.12"
agent.research(topic, max_time=180)  # 3 minutes for search
```

### For marketers:
```python
topic = "AI tools market analysis"
agent.research(topic)
```

---

## What can you get?

- 📝 Structured report with key facts
- 🔍 Comparison of information from different sources
- 💡 Conclusions and recommendations
- 🌐 Links to sources for further study

---

## Limitations

Of course, this is a hobby project, so it has its limitations:

- Works only with open sources
- Requires an API key for AI models
- May miss some details
- Sometimes needs additional result verification

---

## Where to find it?

- 📦 GitHub: [github.com/zerox9dev-space/WebNinja](https://github.com/zerox9dev-space/WebNinja)
- 📱 My Telegram: [Pixels + Code + AI ✨📟⚡️](https://t.me/pixels_code_ai)

## From me

I created this tool for my own needs, but I'll be glad if it helps someone else. You can use it as is or take it as a basis for your own experiments.

If you're interested in the project — subscribe to my Telegram, where I share other useful stuff for designers and developers!

P.S.: This is an experimental project, so use it with an understanding of its limitations. But for quick information gathering — it's a fully working tool! 😉
