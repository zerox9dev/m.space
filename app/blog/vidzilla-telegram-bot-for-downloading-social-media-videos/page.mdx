# How Vidzilla Was Born: From Client Project to Public Bot

![Vidzilla Cover](/images/vidzilla/cover.png)

In this article, I want to share the story of creating Vidzilla — a Telegram bot for downloading videos from social media that is now used by several hundred people.

## Creation Story

It all started quite prosaically — with a client request. I received an order to develop a Telegram bot that would allow downloading videos from various social networks. I implemented a basic version with core functionality, and the client was satisfied.

After completing the project, I realized this idea could be developed further. I liked the concept itself and decided to create my own improved version of the bot with expanded functionality. That's how Vidzilla was born — a completely free bot for personal use that I simply deployed on hosting.

## Bot Functionality

Vidzilla allows downloading videos from popular platforms with one simple action — sending a link:

- **Instagram** - Reels and regular video posts
- **TikTok** - Videos of any length
- **YouTube** - Regular videos and Shorts
- **Facebook** - Videos and Reels
- **Twitter/X** - Videos and GIFs
- **Pinterest** - Video pins

The working principle is extremely simple:
1. User sends a link
2. Bot processes the request
3. Bot returns the video in two formats — as media and as a file

## Technical Aspects

### Basic Structure

The bot is built on Python using the aiogram framework for Telegram API. The basic structure is quite simple:

```python
from aiogram import Bot, Dispatcher, types
from aiogram.utils import executor
from config import BOT_TOKEN
import handlers

# Bot and dispatcher initialization
bot = Bot(token=BOT_TOKEN)
dp = Dispatcher(bot)

# Registering handlers
handlers.register_handlers(dp)

# Running the bot
if __name__ == '__main__':
    executor.start_polling(dp, skip_updates=True)
```

### Processing Videos from Different Platforms

The main technical challenge is the differences in structure and API of various platforms. For each of them, I had to implement a separate approach:

```python
async def process_url(url: str) -> str:
    """Determines the platform by URL and calls the appropriate handler"""
    if "instagram.com" in url:
        return await download_instagram(url)
    elif "tiktok.com" in url:
        return await download_tiktok(url)
    elif "youtube.com" in url or "youtu.be" in url:
        return await download_youtube(url)
    elif "facebook.com" in url or "fb.watch" in url:
        return await download_facebook(url)
    elif "twitter.com" in url or "x.com" in url:
        return await download_twitter(url)
    elif "pinterest" in url:
        return await download_pinterest(url)
    else:
        raise UnsupportedPlatformError("Unsupported platform")
```

### Implementation Features for Different Platforms

**Instagram** requires authorization and working with cookies:

```python
async def download_instagram(url: str) -> str:
    # Using Instaloader for downloading
    # It automatically handles authorization and media retrieval
    L = instaloader.Instaloader()
    
    # Getting post ID from URL
    shortcode = extract_instagram_shortcode(url)
    post = instaloader.Post.from_shortcode(L.context, shortcode)
    
    # Downloading video
    video_path = f"temp_videos/{shortcode}.mp4"
    L.download_post(post, target=os.path.dirname(video_path))
    
    return video_path
```

**TikTok** frequently updates its protection systems, so I had to use specialized APIs:

```python
async def download_tiktok(url: str) -> str:
    # Using RapidAPI for TikTok
    # This simplifies bypassing TikTok's restrictions
    response = await make_api_request(
        "social-media-video-downloader.p.rapidapi.com",
        "/tiktok",
        {"url": url}
    )
    
    video_url = response["data"]["video_url"]
    
    # Downloading video from the obtained link
    video_path = f"temp_videos/{uuid.uuid4()}.mp4"
    await download_file(video_url, video_path)
    
    return video_path
```

## Lessons Learned from the Project

Working on Vidzilla taught me several important things:

1. **Code Reuse** — client projects can be adapted to create useful public tools
2. **Working with APIs** — it's necessary to consider constant changes in social platforms' APIs
3. **Asynchronous Programming** — important for quickly processing multiple requests

## User Response

Despite the lack of marketing, several hundred people are currently using the bot. This mainly happens through word of mouth — people share the link with friends when they need to quickly download a video.

The most popular requests are for TikTok and Instagram Reels, which is not surprising given the difficulty of downloading videos from these platforms.

## Future Plans

Although the bot was created mainly for personal use and friends, I plan to develop it further:

1. Optimize YouTube handling (especially for long videos)
2. Add support for new platforms, such as Threads
3. Improve error handling and user notifications

## Try It Yourself

Vidzilla is a completely free bot, and I don't plan to introduce paid features. If you want to try it out:

1. Open Telegram and find [@Vidzillabot](https://t.me/Vidzillabot)
2. Send a link to any video from the supported platforms
3. Receive the video without watermarks
